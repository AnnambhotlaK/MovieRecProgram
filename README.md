# MovieRecProgram
This project serves as a basic recommendation software that suggests critically acclaimed movies by genre.

Write a program that recommends critically acclaimed movies to the user based on genre.

Genres: Action, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Romance, Thriller, Western

Find about 5 movies per genre, providing 3 things: title, release year, and IMDb rating.

First, ask for a genre. Allow autocomplete to give the user options from an initial letter.

Then, once the user enters an appropriate genre, output the most popular films from that genre.

Loop the above, allowing the user to continue searching for movies.

User may quit out of the program after aforementioned output.
